For example, if we wanted to know if some string `s` contained the sequence `'ab'`, we could simply write `'ab'` in `s` which would return `True` or `False`. If, on the other hand, we wanted to know if a string contained `'a'` and then `'b'` with material potentially intervening, we would have to do more. We might write a function like this:"

The logic of the function is that we search the string for the first instance of `'a'` by iterating across the string with the counter `i`. If we find it, we set the value of `aFlag` to `True` and exit the first `while` loop. Then, without resetting `i`, we initiate another `while` loop to look for `'b'`. Not resetting the value of `i` means that the second loop picks up where the first ended. Hence, the `'b'` must follow the (first) `'a'`.\n",
