Bonus task consists of a small project with the purpose of exploring the tools you may need in your own linguistic research. You have to choose a language (except for English or Russian) and present a report on 2-3 libraries for handling it: part-of-speech tagging/lemmatization/word splitting/syntax parser etc. Presentation should include both code samples, results on some test data and report on missing/wrong/flawless features the library has.
